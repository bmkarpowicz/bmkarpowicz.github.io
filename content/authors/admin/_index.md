I am a PhD graduate from the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at 
the Georgia Institue of Technology and Emory University. I completed my PhD in the [Systems Neural Engineering Lab](https://snel.gatech.edu/) under Dr. Chethan Pandarinath. My work combines principles of machine learning and artificial intelligence with
neuroscience. My dissertation work focused on designing approaches that improve the robustness and practicality of neural interface technologies for everyday use.

I studied bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA. My undergraduate research focused on 
understanding auditory processing in nonhuman primates in the [Auditory Research Laboratory](https://auditoryresearchlaboratory.weebly.com/) under Dr. Yale Cohen. In my free time, I enjoy baking, crocheting, CrossFit, and 
spending time with animals.

Presently, I am seeking full-time opportunities in neurotechnology, computational neuroscience, wearable devices, machine learning, and data science.
